#  *Asteroids*

In this project, you will recreate the classic arcade game **Asteroids** using **Pygame**.

You will program:

* A rotating spaceship
* Asteroids that drift across space
* Bullets that destroy asteroids
* Screen wrap mechanics
* Collision detection


---


# Project Requirements
## Classes

### Player Ship

* Rotates left/right with arrow keys
* Thrusts forward with up arrow
* Drifts with momentum (no friction)
* Wraps around screen edges
* Shoots bullets with spacebar

### Bullets

* Travel in ship’s facing direction
* Disappear after 1.5 seconds
* Destroy asteroids on collision

### Asteroids

* Spawn at random positions
* Move in random directions
* Wrap around screen edges
* Split into 2 smaller asteroids when shot
* Smallest asteroids disappear when shot

### Collisions

* Bullet ↔ asteroid
* Ship ↔ asteroid (lose a life)

## 🔹 Milestone 2 – Shooting System

* Add Bullet class
* Fire bullet in facing direction
* Limit fire rate (no bullet spam)

Deliverable: Ship can shoot bullets that disappear after time.

---

## 🔹 Milestone 3 – Asteroids

* Spawn 5 large asteroids
* Random velocity and direction
* Screen wrapping

Deliverable: Asteroids float around screen.

---

## 🔹 Milestone 4 – Collisions & Splitting

* Bullet destroys asteroid
* Large → 2 medium
* Medium → 2 small
* Small → removed

Deliverable: Asteroids split correctly.
